# flickr-lightbox

A simple vanilla JS implementation of a lightbox with (fixed number of) photos from Flickr using Flickr photo search API.

**Demo**: http://ramyac.github.io/flickr-lightbox/

**Instructions to run this repo locally:**

You will need a http server running locally. I recommend using [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) as I find it straight-forward and easy to use. Once you have http-server installed, run `http-server -p <port-number>`. 

For example, if you have http-server running on port 8000, you will have to run `http-server -p 8000`
